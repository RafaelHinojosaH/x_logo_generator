# X Logo Generator

This project generates a stylized X logo using ASCII characters. The logo consists of two diagonals (backslashes and forward slashes) forming an "X" shape. It can be customized by changing the size of the logo.

## Features

- **Customizable Size:** Adjust the size of the logo to suit your needs.
- **Hollow with Bold Borders:** The backslash (`\`) is hollow with bold borders, and the dashes (`-`) are removed for a cleaner appearance.
- **ASCII Art:** The logo is generated entirely using ASCII characters for terminal output.
